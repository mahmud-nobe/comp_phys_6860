## Final Project

### Relative Resonance:

Kinematic information:

pTp_T=1,2,3 GeV/c of the resonance (or just a uniform distribution, for test purposes, I would start with a fixed pTp_T)
mass of resonance and decay particles according to PDG book. Assume both decay into a proton and a π−\pi-.
Lab frame: eta=[-0.5,0.5] (uniform), phi=isotropic, sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV/c

(Lambda(1520) resonance)
