### Complex Number Class

Class implementation of complex number

#### Members:
- a: real value
- b: imaginary value

#### Member Functions:
- Print: show the complex number in its ideal form and its real and imaginary parts
- abs_value: return the absolute value (i.e. the magnitude) of the complex numbers

#### Operators:
- +: complex number addition $a+bi + c+di = (a+b) + (c+d)i$
- +=: complex number addition (in place)
- -: complex number subtraction $a+bi - c+di = (a-b) + (c-d)i$
- -=: complex number subtraction (in place)
- *: complex number multiplication $a+bi \cdot c+di = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i$
- *=: complex number multiplication (in place)
- /: complex number division $a+bi / c+di = (a+b) + (c+d)i$
- /=: complex number division (in place)


including operators +,+=,- and -= and a length/absolute value functuion. 
In addition add multiplication and division operators. 
Provide the class header, class implementation and a test program with two complex numbers illustrating the functionalities of your complex number class.
